# Data_Cleaning-Using-Python

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for data cleaning. The script processes raw data, removes inconsistencies, handles missing values, and prepares the dataset for further analysis.


## Features

1. Handles Missing Values: Detects and fills or removes missing data entries.
2. Removes Duplicate Entries: Identifies and eliminates duplicate records.
3. Standardizes Column Names: Ensures consistency in naming conventions.
4. Corrects Data Formats: Converts date and numerical formats to standard representations.
5. Identifies and Removes Outliers: Uses statistical methods to detect anomalies.
6. Normalizes Text Data: Trims whitespace, corrects capitalization, and standardizes text.
7. Encodes Categorical Variables: Converts categorical data into numerical form for analysis.
8. Merges and Splits Data: Facilitates combining multiple datasets or segmenting a dataset as needed.


## Libraries Used

1. Pandas: Provides powerful data structures for data manipulation and analysis.
2. NumPy: Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions.
3. Seaborn: Used for statistical data visualization.
4. Matplotlib: Provides plotting functionalities to visualize data distributions and trends.
5. Scikit-Learn: It offers tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning.


## Conclusion

Data cleaning is an essential step in any data-driven workflow, ensuring that datasets are accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. This script automates the cleaning process, handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and formatting issues to streamline data preprocessing. Leveraging powerful Python libraries enhances efficiency, making data analysis and machine learning more reliable and insightful.

With this tool, users can save valuable time, reduce errors, and improve the quality of their datasets. Whether you are a data scientist, analyst, or machine learning engineer, this script provides a robust foundation for working with clean and structured data. Contributions and improvements are always welcome to expand its capabilities and adapt to evolving data processing needs.
